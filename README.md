# My Portfolio Website
This project is a minimal portfolio website built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS, following [ForrestKnight's tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0pkpcD8Ms4). While following the tutorial as a foundation, I've made several customizations to enhance my web development skills and create a unique personal portfolio. The most notable modification is the implementation of custom dark mode styling using Tailwind CSS, which adds a personalized touch to the user experience.

The site features a responsive design, ensuring it looks great on all devices, and leverages Vite for fast development and optimized production builds. Through this project, I've deepened my understanding of modern web technologies and best practices in front-end development.

To set up this project locally, clone the repository and follow the standard npm install and npm run dev commands. For production, use npm run build to create an optimized version of the site.

I want to acknowledge ForrestKnight for providing an excellent starting point with his tutorial. This project has allowed me to build upon that knowledge, experimenting with custom styling and gaining hands-on experience with React and Tailwind CSS.
